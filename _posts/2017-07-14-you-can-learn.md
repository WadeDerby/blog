Hello Friends! Per popular requests from my readers, I will be going through some programming tips for novice programmers and those who want to learn how to code. Don’t forget to keep up with my blog posts so you don’t miss anything! Also, I will be sharing a few things on my twitter account so make sure you follow me [@wadederby](https://www.twitter.com/wadederby "Twitter Page") . Enjoy today’s lesson!

The most common questions I am asked by aspiring programmers are: (i) Which programming language is the best? and (ii) Which programming language is the easiest to use? The answer to both questions is the same, it solely depends on what you want to achieve. If for instance you want to build a native mobile app for android devices, you need Java or Kotlin. However for web development you might need HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

For the purpose of this post, they are generally four types of developers (this generalization is done by me, schools of thought will surely have varying opinions). These are web designers (developers), mobile apps developers, desktop app developers and game developers. There are actually a host of other developers like embedded systems developers (car navigation, smart appliances) but I am limiting my scope to the four stated above for simplicity.

An aspiring programmer writes code to solve a problem or satisfy a need. One needs to first research into the particular problem and the easiest entry point for users. If, for instance, you wanted to develop a program for your company, the best would be a desktop app. If it was for a group of your peers the right choice would be a mobile app. Assuming, you need a centralized platform for both your company to interact with branches the most suitable would be a web app.

I am a web developer and I’ve been working on web apps for close to half a decade. I initially started learning HTML because I wanted to build a search engine. When I began I had no clue as to how a request sent from a PC to a web server returns a page (groups of pages). I just knew what I wanted to do needed to be a website, so I started researching — the best languages to code websites, frameworks, the whole nine yards. My journey has brought me to this point, where working on websites isn’t as daunting a challenge as it used to be.

There might be a few who just want to learn to code as a skill without going mainstream into heavy development. My choice of language is Python. I won’t bore you with geek jargon and “features”. However, here are a few reasons I recommend python: it is easy to understand, very flexible and it is the 4th most used language on Github meaning it has a large community of users. Programming is easy with enough dedication you’ll be coding like a pro in no time.
